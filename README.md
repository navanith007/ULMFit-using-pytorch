# ULMFit-using-pytorch

1. This ipynb contains ULMFiT using Pytorch on text data.
2. ULMFiT stands for Universal Language Model Fine Tuning. It is used as transfer model on small text datasets so that we no need to develop
   new Deep Learning architecture for text data.
3. This code is implemented by following tutorial from the following website https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/11/tutorial-text-classification-ulmfit-fastai-library/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=top-pretrained-models-nlp-article
